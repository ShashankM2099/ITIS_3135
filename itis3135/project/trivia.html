            <h2>The drink dates back to 800 A.D.</h2>
            Legend has it that 9th-century goat herders noticed the effect caffeine had on their goats, who appeared to "dance" after eating the fruit of the Coffea plant. A local monk then made a drink with the produce and found that it kept him awake at night,
            thus the original cup of coffee was born.

            <h2>Coffee beans are technically seeds.</h2>
            They're the pits of the cherry-like berries found on the flowering shrubs, but we call them "beans" because of the resemblance to legumes.

            <h2>And you can eat coffee cherries as a food..</h2>
            Early on, people mixed coffee berries with fat to create an energy-rich snack ball, according to PBS. They would also ferment the pulp to make a wine-like drink (yum!?).

            <h2>There are two main types: Arabica and Robusta.</h2>
            <div>Growers predominantly plant the Arabica species. Although less popular, Robusta tastes slightly more bitter and contains more caffeine.
