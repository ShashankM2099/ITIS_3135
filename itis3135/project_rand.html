        <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>

        <p>Before we delve in deep studying...Ask yourself this</p>
        <h2>Why learn JavaScript???????</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is among the most powerful and flexible programming languages of the web. It powers the dynamic behavior on most websites, including this one.</p>
        <h2>Well there is trade-off too: Take-Away Skills--></h2>
        <p>You will learn programming fundamentals and basic object-oriented concepts using the latest JavaScript syntax. The concepts covered in these lessons lay the foundation for using JavaScript in any environment.</p>
        <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>JavaScript ("JS " for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich (co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation). JavaScript
            is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!</p>
        <p>JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D
                graphics and audio samples.</li>
            <br>

            <li>Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Simple--but neat
            <important><i>Hello World!!! Example</i> </important>
        </h3>
        <p>JavaScript is one of the most popular modern web technologies! As your JavaScript skills grow, your websites will enter a new dimension of power and creativity.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>However, getting comfortable with JavaScript is more challenging than getting comfortable with HTML and CSS. You may have to start small, and progress gradually. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to your test site and create a new folder named scripts. Within the scripts folder, create a new file called <strong>main.js,</strong> and save it.</li>
            <li>In your <strong>index.html</strong> file, enter this code on a new line, just before the closing<strong> body tag</strong>/li>
                <li>This is doing the same job as the
                    <link> element for CSS. It applies the JavaScript to the page, so it can have an effect on the HTML (along with the CSS, and anything else on the page).</li>
                <li>Add this code to the main.js file:
                    <p>const myHeading = document.querySelector('h1');
                        <br> myHeading.textContent = 'Hello world!';</p>
                </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>SO you noticed something must have changed..something happened...</h3>
        <h3>What really happened????</h3>
        <p>The heading text changed to Hello world! using JavaScript. You did this by using a function called querySelector() to grab a reference to your heading, and then store it in a variable called myHeading. This is similar to what we did using CSS
            selectors. When you want to do something to an element, you need to select it first.</p>

        <p>If you really want to know how JavaScript works you can check my buttons I made using JavaScript.
            <br>
            <button onclick="askUser() ">Tap ME!</button>
            <button onclick="askHow() ">Ask for User</button>
            <button onclick="funny() ">Provide an Insult</button>
            <button onclick="addition() ">+Add two numbers +</button>
            <button onclick="tax() ">Calculate the Tax </button>
            <p id="name "></p>
            <p id="health "></p>
            <p id="insult "></p>
            <p id="add "></p>
            <p id="tax "></p>
            <script src="scripts/alert.js "></script>
