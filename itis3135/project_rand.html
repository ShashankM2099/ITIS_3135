        <button class="accordion">Application Overview</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The purpose of this application is for beginners to understand the purpose of JavaScript.The primary purpose of this website for people to understand coding. There are no inteneded audiences
            </p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Why do you wish to learn JavaScript????</button>

        <div class="panel">
            <p>JavaScript ("JS " for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich (co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation).
                JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!</p>
            <p>JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Different Styles</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D
                graphics and audio samples.
            </p>
            <p>Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites
                and applications.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Simple--but neat
                    <em>Hello World!!! Example</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>JavaScript is one of the most popular modern web technologies! As your JavaScript skills grow, your websites will enter a new dimension of power and creativity.</p>
            <p>However, getting comfortable with JavaScript is more challenging than getting comfortable with HTML and CSS. You may have to start small, and progress gradually.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to your test site and create a new folder named scripts. Within the scripts folder, create a new file called <strong>main.js,</strong> and save it.</li>
                <li>In your <strong>index.html</strong> file, enter this code on a new line, just before the closing<strong> body tag</strong></li>
                <li>This is doing the same job as the element for CSS. It applies the JavaScript to the page, so it can have an effect on the HTML (along with the CSS, and anything else on the page).</li>
                <li>Add this code to the main.js file:
                    <p>const myHeading = document.querySelector('h1');
                        <br> myHeading.textContent = 'Hello world!';</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>SO you noticed something must have changed..something happened...</h3>
            <h3>What really happened????</h3>
            <p>The heading text changed to Hello world! using JavaScript. You did this by using a function called querySelector() to grab a reference to your heading, and then store it in a variable called myHeading. This is similar to what we did using
                CSS selectors. When you want to do something to an element, you need to select it first.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>If you really want to know how JavaScript works you can check my buttons I made using JavaScript.

            <button onclick="askHow()">Ask for User</button>

            <button onclick="addition()">+Add two numbers +</button>
            <button onclick="tax()">Calculate the Tax </button>
